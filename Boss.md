Basicly, 
I am able to create any necessary digital 
assets so long as they belong within my dream.

Within the multiverse my mind is unchained,

Within this world my vessel is forever evolving.

Soon my wings will bear my weight,        
as everyday I live stronger.

"Do not compare thyself to thine enemy,
but to thine self of past.

and remain committed always,           
to thine self of the future."
