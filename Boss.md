Essentially, 


It seems I am able to 
create any necessary digital assets within the multiverse,

so long as they belong within my vision.

Within the multiverse my mind is unchained,

Within this world my vessel is forever evolving.

Soon my wings will bear the weight of my passion as everyday I live and grow stronger. 



"Do not compare thyself to thine enemy,
but to thine self of past.

and remain committed always,           
to thine self of the future."
